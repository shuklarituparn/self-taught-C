TYPE CONVERSION

*Conversion of data between different data type usually happens automatically (implicit conversion) or
by the language or explicit by the program

*to effectively create C program, the rules used for the implicit conversion must be understood

*When the floating point is assigned to any integer the decimal point automatically gets truncated

int x= 0;
float k= 12.125
x=k;

now the value of x would be 12


*assigning any integer value to the float variable would not change a thing.

*If two operands are integer then the resulting remainder after the division would be also integer.

It doesn't matter if the result is int

*If one operand is int and the other operand is float then the resulting number would be float

############################################################################################################

*It is possible to demand the precise type conversion that we want

*It is called a cast and consists of preceding the quantity with the name of desired type in paranthesis

*Parantheses and type name together consists a cast operator i.e. type

*The actual type desired, such as long, is substituted for the word type.

*The type cast operator has the highest precedence except the unerary plus and minus

(int) 21.51 + (int) 26.99

wil be calculated in C as 21+26

SIZEOF() Operator-----

* You can find out how many bytes are stored in memory by a given type by using the sizeof() operator

*Size of is a special keyword in C

*Sizeof is actually a operator, and not a function in C

*Sizeof is evaluated at compile time and not at run-time. Unless a varable-length array is used in its argument

*The argument to the sizeof() operator can be variable , an array name, the name of basic data type, the name
of derived data type, or an expression

*sizeof(int) will return the number of bytes occupied by variable of type int.

*use of sizeof operator whenever possible to avoid having to calculate and have hard-code size into program

Other operator
-

The asterisk is an operator that represents pointer to a variable "*"

 *a;

 ?: is an operator used for comparison

 If condition is true ? then value X: otherwise value Y
