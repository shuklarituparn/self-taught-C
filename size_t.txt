What is the size_t data type in C?

size_t is an unsigned integral data type which is defined in various header files such as:


<stddef.h>, <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>, <time.h>, <wchar.h>

*Itâ€™s a type which is used to represent the size of objects in bytes and is therefore used as the return type
by the sizeof operator.

*It is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object the host
system can handle.

*Basically the maximum permissible size is dependent on the compiler; if the compiler is 32 bit
then it is simply a typedef(i.e., alias) for unsigned int but if the compiler is 64 bit then it would be a
typedef for unsigned long long.

 *The size_t data type is never negative.

*Therefore many C library functions like malloc, memcpy and strlen declare their arguments and return type
as size_t. For instance,
