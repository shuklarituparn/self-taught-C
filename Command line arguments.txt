* Many times a program is developed that asks the user to enter some data in the terminal

*Information requested can be for example the amount of triangles that you want to draw

*There are two ways the information can be requested from the user:

1. requesting the data from the user

2. supplying the data at the time of execution of the program (command-line-arguments)

*We know that the main() function is a special function in C [entry point of the program]

*When we define main we pass two values to it.

The first one is called (argc= argument count) which is integer value specifyng the number of argumets typed on
the command line.

The second one is called (argv= is an array of character vectors or strings)

*Code in which we pass commmand line argument looks like this
