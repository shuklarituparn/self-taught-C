/* Data while executing a program is stored in a RAM also called as Random Acess Memory.

#.Data in Ram is stored till computer is connected to a power source. After the loss of power the data is lost

# Storage of data can be thought of storing it in a box where the fulled box denotes 1 and the empty one is 0

# Each box respresents one binary digit either 0 or 1

# Each box is called a Bit

# Bits in memory are stored in group of 8 called Byte.

# Each byte is numbered with a number (Address)

# Address of a byte is the unique address of that byte in computer memory

@@ VARIABLES@@

# Constants are the type of data that doesn't change their value throughout the life of the program

# Variables are the type of data that may changed or value assigned as the programs progress

# Variables are names of computer memory locations that store values in a program

# The naming rules of variables state that a variable can be declared by starting with  a letter or underscore (_)
and can be followed by any combination of letter, 0-9 or underscore

example:  Jason, _Variable, jX67

# Declaring a variable is when we declare the type and then the variable name

# The variables are declared as (type-specifier) (variable-name)

# To declare more than one variable either type them in a new line or seperate them by comma

# C requires all the variable to be declared before using. To assign the value to a variable we use "=" sign
