******************************************// Structures in C//**********************************************************

The struct keyword helps to declare structures which are just a collection of variables

struct date{

    int date;
    int month;
    int year;
}

above example shows the compiler how a structure called date looks. it doesn't have memory allocation and the variables
inside the structures are called members.

after the above declaration, variables can be declared of type struct. and memory is allocated for three int values

To declare today's date we can say that:

struct date today;

and we can set the value as:

today.day=25;
today.year=2015;

///*** to check if the month is 12 ***///

if(today.month==12)
    nextMonth=1;

when it comes to evaluation of the expression. Struct members follow the rule as normal variables

century= today.year/100+1

////////////////////////////- DECLARING STRUCTURES AND VARIABLES AT ONCE -//////////////////////////////////////////////

Can declare structures and variables at once, just have to type variable name before ending the struct

struct date{

    int date;
    int month;
    int year;
} today;       //creating structure called date and declaring a variable of type date;


struct date today {22,05,1999}
