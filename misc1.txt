Trigraph Sequences

In general you can use a question mark directl y in a string. The \? escape sequence only exists because there
are nine special sequences of characters called tri g raph sequences that are three-characters sequences for
representing each of the cha racters #, [,], \, ^, ~, \, {, and }:

??= conver ts to # ??( conver ts to [ ??) conver ts to ]

??/ conver ts to \ ??< conver ts to { ??> conver ts to }

??' conver ts to ^ ??! conver ts to | ??- conver ts to ~

These are there for when it is necessar y to write C code in the International Or ganization for Standardization
 ISO invariant cod e set, wh ich d oes not have th ese characters. This is unlikely to apply to you.
You can completely forget about all this unless you want to write a statement suc h as:

printf("What??!\n");

The output produced by this statement wi ll be: What|

The trigraph ??! will be co nv e r ted to | . To get the output you intended, you need to write
the statement as: printf("What?\?!\n");

Now the trigraph sequence does not appear because the second question mark is specified by its escape sequence.

Your compiler may well issue a warning when you use a trigraph sequence because usually it is unintended.

The Pre processor

In the example I explained how you use a preprocessin g directive to include the contents of a header file into
your source file. The preprocessing phase of compilation can do much more than this. As well as directives,
your source file can contain macros. A macro is an instruction to th e preprocessor to add to or modify
the C statements in the program.

A macro can be something as simple as defining a symbol, such as INCHES_PER_FOO T to be replaced by 12
wherever the symbol appears. The directive to do this is:

#define INCHES_PER_FOOT 12

With this directive at t he beginning of your source file, wherever INCHES_PER_FOOT appears in the code,
it will be replaced by 12 . For example:

printf( "There are %d inches in a foot.\n", INCHES_PER_FOOT);

After preprocessing, t his statement wi ll be:

printf("There are %d inches in a foot.\n", 12)
