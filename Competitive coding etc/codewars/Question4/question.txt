An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.
Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

Example: (Input --> Output)

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true "aba" --> false "moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

isIsogram "Dermatoglyphics" = true
isIsogram "moose" = false
isIsogram "aba" = false


Basic idea to approach: Loop through the string
                        Declare a boolen flag
                        as soon as the count reaches 2 the bool triggers giving that it's not an isogram
