Dynamic memory allocation in C

Allows memory for storing data to be allocated dynamically when the program executes

    *makes the use of pointer to do that

Dynamic memory allocation reserves the space in the memory area called heap

There's another memory area called STACK

STACK: Function argument and the local variables in a function are stored here

    *When the execution of the function completes, the memory allocated to store arguments and local argument is freed

The difference in the memory on the stack and the heap is that the memory on the heap is controlled by the user

They must keep a track record of when to allocate the memory and to free them after use.

Must free space in order to re-use them

*******************************************// Malloc() //***************************************************************

 1. Need to use stdlib.h header file

 2. Specify the number of bytes of memory needed as argument

 3. Returns the address of the first byte of the memory it allocated.

 4. As it returns an address, only way to put is a pointer.

 //- SYNTAX -// int *pNumber= (int*) malloc(100); returns 100 bytes of memory

 The command above returns 100 bytes of memory but since the int is 4 bytes it can only store 25 int.

 malloc assumes that the int is 4 bytes. Inorder to remove the assumption and ask it the amount of integer we need

 we do:

 int *pNumber= (int*)malloc(25*sizeof(int)); //asking 25 int.

 The cast (int*) converts the pointer returned by malloc to type int. This is done because malloc returns the pointer
 of type void.

 *. Can store any amount of memory that a user requests

 *. If the memory that a user cannot be allocated, malloc() returns the pointer with value NULL

 *. Good idea to check if the requested memory is there before trying to use it.

  int *pNumber= (int*)malloc(25*sizeof(int));

  if(!pNumber){
        //Code to deal with error if there's empty request to the memory.
  }

  //Display the message and terminate the program. Much better than letting the program crash/

*************************************// Releasing memory //*************************************************************

After allocating memory dynamically, it's required to free it when it's no longer required

*. Memory allocated on the heap will be automatically freed when the program ends.

*. Better to release it before the programs exits.

*. A memory leak happens when you dynamically allot a memory but don't posses an address to it to release it later

*. occurs inside a loop. results in more and more memory being used gradually.

*. To free a memory, need to have its address

*To release a memory that was earlier allotted and whose address we have in a pointer.

free(pNumber);
pNumber=NULL;

as long as pNumber contains the address of the memory that was allotted, it'll free the entire block of the memory.

*Always set the pointer to NULL after the memory it points too have been freed.

*******************************************// Calloc() //***************************************************************

*calloc() offer many adavntages above malloc()

*it allocated space in the memory based on numbers of element needed and their individual size

*it initializes the memory so that all bytes are zero

*calloc() requires two argument values

        *. Number of data items for which the space is required
        *.size of each data items

*calloc() is declared in the stdlib.h header

int *pNumber= (int*) calloc(number_of_element, sizeof(size_of_each_element));

*. Return value will be NULL if the memory cannot be allotted, but unlike malloc() it'll be initialized to 0
