The conditional operator is a unique operator

*Unlike any other operator in C that are binary or unary, it is a ternary operator (accepts three value at once)

The two symbol that are used to represent it are question mark (?) and semi-colon (;)

The first operand is put before (?)

The second one is put after the (?) and before (:)

The third one is put after the (:)

condition (?) expression 1 (:) expression 2

The conditional operator evaluates to one of two expression depending on whether the logical expression
evaluated to true or false

*The ? character follows the logical expression, condition

*On the right of ? are two operands, expression 1, and expression 2, that represent choices.

*The value that results from the expression will be the value of expression 1 if the condition evaluates true

*If the condition evaluates as false the resulting value will be expression 2.

example: x= y>7 ? 25:50

Here the value X will take will be 25 if y>7 or 50 if that's not the case.
