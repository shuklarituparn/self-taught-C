* Methods can be used so that modules contained in the seperate files can effectively
communicate

*if a function from a file needs to call a function in a different file

    *a function call can be made in the normal fashion

    *arguments can be passed and returned the original way

*in the file that calls the function, make sure to include the protoype

*up to the user to provide correct information as the compiler compiles each files seperately

*function contained in the seperate files can communicate through external variables

    *an extention to the concept of global variables


an external variable is the variable whose value can be changed by another file (module)

*Inside the file (module) that wants to access the external variable

    *The variable data type declared with word "extern" in declaration

    *Tells compiler that globally defined variable from other file has to be used

*if want to define an int variable called myNumber and want to use it in function of another file

int myNumber=0;

*Declare the obove on top of and at beginning of the program as a global variable

*declare extern int myNumber; 

    *The value of the myNumber can now be acessed in the new file after the declaration

Static vs Extern variables

*Situations arise in which we wanna declare the variable global but not external

*wanna declare a variable global locally to a given file

static int myNumber=0;

declaring a variable globally with a static keyword will make it available to all the  
function but not to outside the current file
